## Description

This is my hub space for all my work and current contact information for all and any recuiters wanting to get a gist on what projects ive done and what things I can accomplish in the future. I went for a more lighter look as I think its aesthetically pleasing compared to a darker colored contrast. I also really love cherry blossoms, they are one of the most beautiful things in the world to me.

## Portfolio Designs
My designs for my portfolio picture, 

 ```css
.myself {
    height: 500px;
    width: 500px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    border-radius: 50%;
}
 ```

for my contact portion I chose the color pink and had my icons in the ul section flew in a row so that it would look cleaner
 ```css
 .Contact{
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    padding: 40px;
    height: 400px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    font-size: 45px;
    background-color: pink;
}
.Contact ul{
    display: flex;
    justify-content:space-around;
    list-style-type: none;
}

 ```
